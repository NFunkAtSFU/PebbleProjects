# PebbleProjects
Working through the tutorials posted on [https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/part1/index.html]

To keep the directory lean, I am not including the asset files for images or fonts, only the source code. In most cases, I am sticking with the syntax of the given tutorial. The natswatch project builds on what I learned from the tutorials to make a watchface of my own design.
